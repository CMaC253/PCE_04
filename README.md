C# Exercises

## Please consider the following:
 If you clone the project and run it in VS you will notice you can debug different functions because they all will be ran at once.

### The Following topics are displayed here:
  - Parameters
  - Return Values
  - Testing Randomness
  - Class Construction & OOP principles 
    - Look at Max & Return_Values classes, and HelperClass & Testing_Randomness  
  - Array Basics
    - Returning arrays, Methods of arrays, summing arrays, Fibonnaci sequence.
  
```
Open at Program.cs in the top folder to analyze the code
```

Not all of the functions will be filled out but at this portion of the class we did not have NUnit tests to consider.
